# Slowsort

This repository contains source code from my blog post about Slow Sort algorithm implementation in Elixir.

Post in Polish language is available [here]().
  
## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `slowsort` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:slowsort, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/slowsort](https://hexdocs.pm/slowsort).
